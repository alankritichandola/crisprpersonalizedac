      <h2>Personalized Therapeutics Framework</h2>
      
      <h3>Three Pillars of Personalized CRISPR Medicine</h3>
      <p>CRISPR-based therapeutics mark a significant advancement toward personalised medicine, offering genome editing tailored to a patient's specific mutation, disease mechanism, and clinical profile. Personalized CRISPR approaches rely on three main pillars: accurate target identification, effective delivery to relevant tissues, and ongoing safety evaluation. Recent progress highlights editing methods that aim to maximize therapeutic gains while reducing the risk of off-target genetic changes. <a href="references.html#ref9" class="citation">[9]</a></p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>1. Personalized Treatment of Monogenic Diseases</h2>
      
      <h3>Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and β-Thalassemia</h3>
      <p>Sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia are now key examples in CRISPR clinical translation. Treatments usually involve editing hematopoietic stem cells outside the body to either restore fetal hemoglobin production or fix disease-causing mutations. These disorders are ideal for this approach because the target cells can be extracted, edited, and then reinjected into the patient, allowing for precise and personalized therapy. <a href="references.html#ref9" class="citation">[9]</a>, <a href="references.html#ref2" class="citation">[2]</a></p>
      
      <h3>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)</h3>
      <p>DMD results from mutations in the dystrophin gene, making it a prime target for mutation-specific CRISPR correction strategies. Techniques like exon skipping, gene reframing, or targeted repair seek to restore some dystrophin function. Nevertheless, hurdles still exist in effectively delivering these therapies to both skeletal and cardiac muscles. <a href="references.html#ref9" class="citation">[9]</a></p>
      
      <h3>Leber Congenital Amaurosis 10 (LCA10)</h3>
      <p>LCA10 is an inherited retinal disorder in which CRISPR therapy has been studied through direct in vivo editing. Since the eye is an immune-privileged and accessible organ, targeted genome editing provides a promising approach for personalized treatment. Initial clinical studies demonstrate both the feasibility and the importance of long-term assessment of retinal editing results. <a href="references.html#ref2" class="citation">[2]</a></p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>2. Cancer Immunotherapy</h2>
      
      <h3>CAR-T Cell Engineering</h3>
      <p>CRISPR has revolutionised cancer immunotherapy by facilitating the engineering of immune cells with increased anti-tumor abilities. In CAR-T therapy, CRISPR is employed to modify T cells, improving receptor specificity, knocking out inhibitory pathways, or boosting their persistence. This advancement enables highly personalized cell-based treatments, especially for blood cancers. <a href="references.html#ref10" class="citation">[10]</a></p>
      
      <h3>Allogeneic "Off-the-Shelf" CAR-T Cells</h3>
      <p>A significant advancement is the creation of universal donor CAR-T cells. Using CRISPR, scientists can delete endogenous T-cell receptors and immune recognition molecules, which lessens the risk of graft-versus-host disease. These approaches could also enhance accessibility by minimising the requirement for patient-specific production. <a href="references.html#ref10" class="citation">[10]</a></p>
      
      <h3>Direct Tumor Editing</h3>
      <p>Apart from immune cells, CRISPR is also explored for directly targeting tumours, such as by disrupting oncogenes or restoring tumor suppressor pathways. Although this approach is theoretically strong, it encounters major challenges like delivery issues, tumor heterogeneity, and off-target effects. <a href="references.html#ref10" class="citation">[10]</a></p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>3. Infectious Disease Applications</h2>
      
      <h3>HIV/AIDS Treatment</h3>
      <p>CRISPR strategies for HIV focus on either removing proviral DNA from host genomes or altering host receptors like CCR5 to prevent the virus from entering cells. While these methods show potential for functional cures, challenges like viral diversity and ensuring safe delivery continue to be significant hurdles. <a href="references.html#ref11" class="citation">[11]</a></p>
      
      <h3>Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)</h3>
      <p>HBV remains through stable covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which complicates eradication efforts. CRISPR technology targeting viral DNA has become a promising approach to interfere with replication templates. Nonetheless, ensuring precision and preventing hepatotoxicity are crucial for successful clinical application. <a href="references.html#ref11" class="citation">[11]</a></p>
      
      <h3>Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)</h3>
      <p>HSV establishes a latent infection in neurons, which complicates antiviral efforts. Researchers are exploring CRISPR techniques to target these hidden viral genomes, aiming for long-term suppression or a cure. However, delivering these treatments into neural tissues continues to be a major challenge. <a href="references.html#ref11" class="citation">[11]</a></p>
      
      <h3>Antimicrobial Applications</h3>
      <p>CRISPR has also been suggested as a programmable antimicrobial approach, capable of specifically targeting bacterial resistance genes or pathogenic strains. These uses could allow for precise microbiome editing, but regulatory and ecological issues need to be considered. <a href="references.html#ref11" class="citation">[11]</a></p>

      <h2>4. Regenerative Medicine and Organ Transplantation</h2>
      
      <h3>Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)</h3>
      <p>Genome editing in iPSCs allows for the correction of mutations that cause diseases prior to differentiating into therapeutic cells. This opens up possibilities for personalized regenerative medicine, such as patient-derived cell replacement therapies. <a href="references.html#ref9" class="citation">[9]</a></p>
      
      <h3>Xenotransplantation</h3>
      <p>CRISPR technology has facilitated the modification of animal organs, especially pig organs, for human transplants. By eliminating immunogenic components and endogenous viral sequences, genome editing enhances compatibility and safety, marking a significant future trend in personalized transplantation medicine. <a href="references.html#ref12" class="citation">[12]</a></p>

      <h2>5. Agricultural Applications</h2>
      
      <h3>Crop Improvement</h3>
      <p>CRISPR has become widely used to enhance crop traits like yield, stress tolerance, and disease resistance. Unlike conventional genetic modification, CRISPR allows for precise, targeted edits without adding foreign DNA, which boosts its acceptance and accuracy.</p>
      
      <h3>Notable Crop Developments</h3>
      <p>Examples include enhanced rice varieties, drought-tolerant wheat, and disease-resistant tomatoes. These advances showcase how CRISPR is expanding beyond medicine to address global food security.</p>
      
      <h3>Livestock Engineering</h3>
      <p>Genome editing in livestock has been employed to improve disease resistance and productivity. However, ethical issues and potential long-term ecological effects are important factors to consider when using these technologies.</p>
