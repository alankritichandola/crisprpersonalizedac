    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Sickle Cell Disease and β-Thalassemia</h2>
      
      <h3>Ex Vivo Hematopoietic Stem Cell Editing and FDA Approval of Casgevy</h3>
      <p>Sickle cell disease (SCD) and β-thalassemia are among the most advanced and clinically successful applications of CRISPR-based therapeutics. Both disorders arise from mutations affecting hemoglobin function, leading to severe anemia and systemic complications. Because these are monogenic blood disorders, they are well-suited for genome editing approaches that directly target the genetic root of disease. <a href="references.html#ref2" class="citation">[2]</a></p>
      <p>A major therapeutic strategy involves ex vivo editing of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). In this approach, stem cells are collected from the patient, edited in the laboratory using CRISPR-Cas9, and then reinfused after conditioning therapy. This method allows genome editing outcomes to be assessed before transplantation, improving safety and control compared to direct in vivo editing. <a href="references.html#ref9" class="citation">[9]</a></p>
      <p>One of the most widely used editing targets in these therapies is the BCL11A enhancer, a regulatory element that suppresses fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression. By disrupting this enhancer, CRISPR editing reactivates HbF production, which can compensate for defective adult hemoglobin and significantly reduce disease symptoms in both SCD and β-thalassemia patients. <a href="references.html#ref9" class="citation">[9]</a></p>
      <p>Importantly, CRISPR-based treatment for sickle cell disease has moved beyond experimental stages into real clinical translation. The approval of the first CRISPR therapy, Casgevy (exa-cel), represents a historic milestone demonstrating that genome editing can be successfully applied as a personalized therapeutic platform in modern medicine. <a href="references.html#ref2" class="citation">[2]</a></p>
      <p>Despite this progress, challenges remain, including long-term monitoring of edited cell populations, potential off-target effects, accessibility, and the high cost of therapy. Nevertheless, SCD and β-thalassemia remain the strongest proof-of-concept that CRISPR can deliver durable, mutation-targeted cures through personalized genome engineering. <a href="references.html#ref12" class="citation">[12]</a></p>

      <h2>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)</h2>
      
      <h3>Mutation-Specific CRISPR Strategies for Dystrophin Restoration</h3>
      <p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a serious inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin (DMD) gene, leading to progressive muscle deterioration and loss of function. Since the disease stems from well-characterised genetic defects, it is considered a prime candidate for CRISPR-based personalized therapy intervention. <a href="references.html#ref9" class="citation">[9]</a></p>
      <p>CRISPR strategies for DMD mainly aim to restore dystrophin expression by using mutation-specific genome editing techniques. These approaches include targeted exon deletion, exon skipping, or reframing disrupted coding regions. Their goal is to transform severe out-of-frame mutations into partly functional dystrophin variants, resembling those seen in milder Becker muscular dystrophy. <a href="references.html#ref9" class="citation">[9]</a></p>
      <p>Additionally, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been investigated as a means for personalized correction of dystrophin mutations. These patient-derived iPSCs can be genetically edited in vitro and then differentiated into muscle cells, providing a promising approach for regenerative treatments and mutation-specific therapies. <a href="references.html#ref9" class="citation">[9]</a></p>
      <p>Although CRISPR shows promise for treating DMD, significant obstacles remain. The main challenges include effectively delivering the therapy across extensive skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues. Additionally, issues such as long-term safety, immune reactions to Cas proteins, and off-target effects need thorough evaluation before it can be widely used in clinical settings. <a href="references.html#ref12" class="citation">[12]</a></p>
      <p>Overall, DMD underscores the potential and challenges of using CRISPR for personalized treatment of large-gene disorders. Ongoing improvements in delivery methods and precise editing technologies will be essential for securing long-lasting clinical results in muscular dystrophy patients.</p>

      <h2>Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA10)</h2>
      
      <h3>In Vivo Retinal Genome Editing Trials</h3>
      <p>Leber congenital amaurosis type 10 (LCA10) is an uncommon inherited retinal disease caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene, resulting in significant vision loss beginning in early childhood. Since LCA10 stems from a well-understood genetic defect and impacts an accessible, localised tissue, it has become one of the most promising candidates for CRISPR-based in vivo gene editing treatments. <a href="references.html#ref2" class="citation">[2]</a></p>
      <p>Unlike ex vivo blood stem cell therapies, CRISPR approaches for LCA10 involve directly delivering genome editing components into retinal cells in vivo. The eye is a favourable target for gene therapy because of its immune-privileged status and the possibility of localized injections, which minimise systemic exposure and decrease off-target risks.</p>
      <p>Therapeutic strategies focus on fixing or interfering with harmful mutations in CEP290 to restore gene function in photoreceptor cells. Initial clinical trials show that delivering CRISPR components to human retinal tissue is possible, representing a significant breakthrough in expanding genome editing beyond blood-related diseases. <a href="references.html#ref2" class="citation">[2]</a></p>
      <p>However, obstacles persist in guaranteeing long-term editing safety, preventing accidental retinal damage, and attaining adequate editing efficiency in non-dividing neuronal cells. These challenges emphasise the broader requirement for enhanced delivery vectors and more precise editing technologies to enable successful in vivo therapies. <a href="references.html#ref12" class="citation">[12]</a></p>
      <p>Overall, LCA10 stands as a landmark case that showcases the potential of CRISPR in treating inherited diseases via localized in vivo genome editing. It provides a pathway toward future personalized therapies for various genetic eye disorders.</p>

      <h2>Cancer Immunotherapy</h2>
      
      <h3>CRISPR-Engineered CAR-T Cells and Immune Checkpoint Editing</h3>
      <p>Cancer immunotherapy has become a leading application of CRISPR genome editing, especially in engineering immune cells for personalized therapies. Unlike monogenic diseases, cancer's genetic complexity and variability demand flexible treatments that can be customised to the unique features of each tumour and patient. <a href="references.html#ref10" class="citation">[10]</a></p>
      <p>One of the most advanced strategies uses CRISPR to improve chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies. In this approach, T cells taken from patients are genetically engineered to recognize tumor-associated antigens, enhancing their capacity to target and eliminate cancer cells. CRISPR editing can further boost CAR-T effectiveness by disabling inhibitory pathways or increasing immune persistence. <a href="references.html#ref10" class="citation">[10]</a></p>
      <p>A prime example is knocking out immune checkpoint genes like PD-1, which typically inhibit T-cell activity in the tumor microenvironment. Using CRISPR to remove PD-1, engineered T cells could show enhanced anti-tumor responses, demonstrating how genome editing can boost therapeutic effectiveness in cancer treatment. <a href="references.html#ref12" class="citation">[12]</a></p>
      <p>CRISPR is also being investigated for creating universal allogeneic CAR-T cells, in which donor immune cells are edited to minimise immune rejection and graft-versus-host disease. These 'off-the-shelf' approaches have the potential to enhance accessibility and scalability compared to fully personalised manufacturing. <a href="references.html#ref10" class="citation">[10]</a></p>
      <p>Although CRISPR-based cancer therapies show great promise, they encounter challenges such as off-target effects, immune safety issues, and tumor escape mechanisms. Despite these hurdles, cancer immunotherapy remains a leading area of innovation within personalized CRISPR treatments, with ongoing clinical trials showing swift advancements towards wider clinical use. <a href="references.html#ref12" class="citation">[12]</a></p>

      <h2>HIV and Viral Genome Targeting</h2>
      
      <h3>Emerging Antiviral CRISPR Approaches</h3>
      <p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to pose a significant global health challenge because it can establish persistent infections by integrating its DNA into the host genome. While standard antiretroviral treatments can reduce viral replication, they do not eradicate latent viral reservoirs, requiring lifelong therapy. Recently, CRISPR-based genome editing has emerged as a promising approach to target HIV at its genetic core.</p>
      <p>One therapeutic method employs CRISPR-Cas systems to specifically target and remove proviral DNA sequences from infected host cells. By cleaving integrated viral genomes, CRISPR could decrease or eradicate latent reservoirs, potentially enabling long-term functional cure approaches instead of ongoing viral suppression. <a href="references.html#ref11" class="citation">[11]</a></p>
      <p>Beyond targeting viral DNA, CRISPR has been investigated for editing host factors essential for HIV entry and replication. For instance, disrupting the CCR5 co-receptor gene has been suggested as a protective strategy, inspired by individuals naturally resistant due to CCR5 mutations. These host-focused methods demonstrate CRISPR's adaptability in developing antiviral therapies. <a href="references.html#ref12" class="citation">[12]</a></p>
      <p>Despite its promise, antiviral genome editing faces significant challenges, including efficient delivery into relevant immune cell populations, viral sequence diversity, and the risk of unintended off-target mutations. Ethical and biosecurity concerns are also important, as genome editing technologies could potentially be misused if not carefully regulated. <a href="references.html#ref8" class="citation">[8]</a></p>
      <p>Overall, HIV serves as a significant emerging case for CRISPR therapeutics, illustrating how genome editing could extend beyond inherited disorders to treat infectious diseases. Ongoing improvements in delivery methods, safety mechanisms, and clinical testing will shape the future viability of CRISPR-based antiviral therapies.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Summary</h2>
